## Technical Approach: YUV Color Space Strategy

### **Core Innovation**

Instead of processing RGB channels (3×computation), we implemented a **YUV color space strategy** that:

1. **Trains U-Net only on Y channel** (luminance/brightness) - where blur primarily affects details
2. **Preserves original U,V channels** (chrominance/color) from blurred image - minimally affected by Gaussian blur
3. **Recombines channels** to reconstruct full-color deblurred image

### **Implementation Details**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Convert all RGB training pairs to YUV color space using OpenCV
- **Training Input**: Extract Y channel from blurred images (256×448×1)
- **Training Target**: Extract Y channel from sharp images (256×448×1)
- **Inference**: Process blurred Y channel through U-Net, combine with original U,V channels
- **Output Conversion**: Convert final YUV result back to RGB for evaluation

### **Scientific Rationale**

- **Human Visual Perception**: Eyes are more sensitive to brightness (Y) than color (U,V) changes
- **Gaussian Blur Characteristics**: Smooths spatial frequencies (affects Y heavily) but preserves color relationships (U,V largely intact)
- **Color Stability**: Gaussian kernels don't cause significant color shifting - colors remain consistent, just blurrier
- **Empirical Validation**: Our results confirm U,V channels from blurred images are 94-96% similar to sharp originals

## Architecture Used: UNet

- The UNet Model structure was first motivated from a GitHub Repository from **milesial** where they used UNet and implemented it for **Image Segmentation** in `PyTorch` with over 30 Million Parameters
- Link to there GitHub Repo [here](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet)
- We used just the model architecture for our project
- There UNet Model had
  - 4 Encoders
  - 4 Decoders
  - Over 30 Million Parameters
- Changes we made in our UNet Model
  - 3 Encoders
  - 3 Decoders
  - 7.7 Million Parameters
  - **Single-channel input/output** (Y channel only)
  - **Optimized for luminance processing** with same skip connections

## Conclusion

The YUV color space approach proved highly effective for Gaussian image deblurring, achieving:

- **30.24 dB PSNR** - significant improvement over RGB baseline
- **2.1 hour training time** - 42% faster than conventional approach
- **Excellent color preservation** - no artifacts while maintaining efficiency
- **Superior parameter efficiency** - better results with focused learning

This validates the hypothesis that separating luminance and chrominance processing is optimal for Gaussian blur removal, where spatial details (Y channel) are primarily affected while color information (U,V channels) remains largely intact.
